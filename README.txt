# Project-Customer

This is Project-Customer. In this project we had 3 weeks to create a interactive application to support an add campaign of an organization that fights a social problem. We chose to work with support ocean cleanup, and bring awareness to the tasks they do like remove plastic and other garbage from rivers and oceans. We did this by making a game where you control a fleet of cleanup ships with the goal of cleaning part of the ocean before it gets too filthy.
